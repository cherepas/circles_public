creating csv - makes tables for F_N and Far out of single files
ellipse - custom NN for regression ellipses
FtoF_N_fixed_dirs_Y_N - regress F_N out of F with fixed direction. Loss calculates between F and F_GT
FtoF_N_fixed_dirs - regress F_N out of F with fixed direction. Loss calculates between F_N and F_N_GT
FtoF_N - regress F_N from F with arbitrary directions
self-supervised_sh_3d - self-supervised learning of F_N from ply input
sh-plot - drawing 3d figure out of F_N
sh - regression of SH and ellipse parameters with custom NN. Validation set selects manually by first batch. 
umeyama - algorithm how to allign two point cloud relative to each other with least square errors method. 
elfit - fit ellipsoid to 2d or 3d images of seeds
finetune_test - fit SH to 2d or 3d images of seeds with standard NN
