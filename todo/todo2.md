# Improved appearance 
- print out not only opt, but also parameters from argparse from the sh file
  - Split line using regexp, that every parameter name starts with a minus sign. If it is a binary parameter (there is the next parameter with a minus sign), then just paste True or False in the column of values
- Draw a vertical line to split mini-batches one from each other
- Enable single seed loss output
- 

# Resultative improvements
- Organize special files with different if-else conditions for every step in training: 
  * prepare input data 
  * preparing output data
  * prepare Dataset output
- Compare center of masses for first 2500 point clouds, if it makes sense to subtract mean for them
# Automate manual postprocessing
- Render multiple md files as a single (useful for long tables)
- Synchronize plot output between devices to consolidate them together, but ignore large files, like the model, vector output, etc. 
- 
# Tips from meeting on 21.12.2021
- Regress only 6 elements of the upper-triangular matrix, which contains information about the pose. For every seed calculate second moments (MatLab script for normalization on canonical view). For the other views, firstly rotate the point cloud at exactly 10 degrees.
- At this configuration, the axis of rotation is vertical, so that one pose angle is fixed, and the other is incremented for rotation. Then calculate the second-moment matrix. After that ask network to regress the pose directly from images, as just 6 values in the output. Alternatively, one can try to regress two angles directly.
- The next step is to include information about the center of masses of the point cloud, this will be additionally 3 parameters.
- After this works with small latent space like 2 or 4, increase shape space.
- Basis function should be smoother
- Check what is 0,0,0 of every point cloud. Is it not the camera center?
- What is the vector towards the center of masses?
- Try to output 9 seeds (3x3)
- Show seed with most elongated part
- Plot legend, what is ground truth, and what is model output
# Plan for 14.01, 15.01, 17.01
- Prepare update report for 17.01
- Automatize several things to make update reports faster
  - Find csv2md on python
  - Save as a postprocessing file with functions to produce output automatically

# Questions
- Every seed rotates relatively to the holder tip. How to find holder tip position for every seed? 
- There is a difference if calculate moments from the original point cloud or point cloud with subtracted mean.![img_3.png](img_3.png) when I calculate mean, it already includes shape, because it depends on the shape, and center of masses is different from the tip position coordinate. The problem here is that I don't know the position of the tip in 3d or 2d. I only have camera center coordinates in 3d from the camera matrix. ![img_7.png](img_7.png)![img_8.png](img_8.png)![img_9.png](img_9.png)
- For every rotation angle should I regress
  - pose separately for every angle, process every rotation as a new entry (data-point)
  - regress pose and then rotate it on the known angle, and then calculate loss from the GT
- Should I regress 6 values directly from moments (X*X, X*Y, ..., Z*Z), or calculate the rotation matrix from finding eigenvalues? 



# Hanno tips on 17.01.2022
- Reconstruct not (XX, XY, ..), because it depends on size, but orientation matrix, gained from the decomposition of this matrix. 
  - Check How many points of freedom it has. It should be only 3, ![img_10.png](img_10.png), because 3 angle can describe every rotation. Another assumption, that the matrix is antisymmetrical. Is it? Or orthogonal?
  - Then try to add center of masses.
- Ask Andreas Fischbach to get the source code, how were point clouds generated. 
- If it find center and pose, it can do shape. Finally, 3D loss should include pose (and center of masses) loss
- Reread the article "What shape are dolphins". Classical fitting. 
  - Check how they track nose, flug, spine
- Check information about center of masses distribution, camera center distribution for the first 2500 seeds
- In 2. you may want to test, if using separate networks with shared weights -- one per image -- till the latent space and then joining them for pose regression may work better.

- Sort eigenvalues in ascending order to save them in the same way for different seeds
- Multiply orientation matrix on sign of determinant, to have the same sign of the matrix for different seeds
- Find calculation error, when trying to get **arcsin** from 1.0000000001.
- Orientation matrix consisting of eigenvectors is orthogonal.

# TODO from 24.01 to 31.01
- using separate networks with shared weights -- one per image -- till the latent space and then joining them for pose regression
- Regress pose and center of masses from images
  - Shift point cloud to have it projected with the same projection matrix on every corresponding image.


# Question to Hanno

- Does it make sense to regress ellipsoid from the images? Is it the same problem, as to regress 3 values for the pose, and 3 for the coordinate of the center
- Does it make sense to try regress pose from point cloud? It would be just a single matrix learn.

## Appendix

###TODO check that multiplication of rotation matrix C on orientation matrix will give the same result, as multiplication of C by point cloud. 

Sort eigenvalues to make them in ascending order.

![img_1.png](C:/cherepashkin1/598test/plot_output/e066/078l/loss_out/Average_loss_minibatch_val_Loss.png)

Found that it is the same to first subtract mean and then rotate, or first rotate point cloud and then subtract mean. 

It is not the same, if calculate orientation matrix from rotated point cloud. 

-![img_11.png](img_11.png) is it ok, or antidiagonal elements should be not the same
- Determinant of orientation matrix is -1

# Hanno's tips on 24.01
- Permute GT vectors, as NN can accidentially flip axes. 
- If regress eul angles, take into account peridiocity. That -pi = 0 = pi for directions.
  - if regress 3x3 orientation matrix, multiplication on -1 should be the same.
  - Look how found minimum angles between two rays.
  - Pay attention, that eigenvectors is not orientation. We need orientation, not direction. So ray has two ends. 
- When evaluate model and regress 3x3 matrix, estimate closest orthogonal vector basis, because model output is not orthogonal
  - Calculate closest orthogonal during training can be computationally expensive
- Treat independent datapoints (in batch channel). Concatenate output of the network in last convolutional output of the network. Or in the first FC layer. Add additional FC layer of size 32 or 128, for example. 
- For ellipsoid fitting, read Direct least square fitting of ellipses https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/765658

# Update report for 31.01.2022

Applied augmentation:
- Multiply 3x3 orientation matrix on -1. 
- Permute columns
- Calculate the closest set of vectors, making an orthonormal matrix.

For experiment with multiple views, one should decrease batch size, otherwise there are not enough memory
# TODO
- Copy name of the sh file to the output folder to stop saturated training
- How to save output loss figure when using multiple GPUs?
- Write callback to automatically stop saturated training
- automatically delete folders with failed experiments
- Save and synchronize loss using numpy savetxt.
- Run experiment, 
  - if with more images I have better regression of the pose
  - If increasing size of one before last FC layer is better
  - Try to regress center of masses.
# Questions to Hanno:
- Can I just use min((loss(outputs, GT), loss(outputs, -GT))) in validation?
- Should I use fixed augmentation for validation loss calculation or it is free? 
- Writing a report for JSC
- How to technically share weights?
- When regress center of mass, should I also include loss for the pose?

scaling and 
Scaling matrix by factor of 2, keep other fixed, S = diag(2, 1, 1)
Point x is being 3d point, coordinate system of the camera, 
seed is not oriented in camera direction, but rotated. 
If we have this scaling, to calculate x', that x'= R.T * S * R * x, 
vector x is projected to the three unified vectors of coordinate system of the seed. X is diagonal matrix, we require main axis of the seed to be the first eigenvalue of that matrix, the first horizontal vector in R. Is coordinate vector along the main axis of the seed. 

R is horizontal vectors, three horizontal vectors, Unit vectors, the vector, they are unit length. 
R*x is the projection to the new eigensystem. Then it is scaling, (multiply by S), then transform back.
R for rotation
R 

Requirements for 
- right handed / left
- positive half-space
Vectors of rotation.
- .X is vertical 
- If it is on the unit sphere, it should be les than 1. If vector is in the positive half-space, the sign. 
- X component is positive. Flip the whole vector if it is negative. 
- The same test. If the first is not positive, flip. 
- For the third right handed eigensystem. 
- cross product of the first two, then scalar product of the x3, if it is not negative projection 
v = (x3, [x1, x2]). if v is positive, keep x3 as is, and if v is negative, flip. 

# Hanno's tips 31.01.2022
- Flip vectors separately from each other, not the multiplication of the whole matrix by -1. 
- Take care when it is close to the flipping point. Check sign of projection (x3, [x1, x2]) in order to decide flip sign or not. 
- Check, whether validation loss is smaller if use only sign flip. One can flip signs every time depending on the output of the NN. 
- In order to get rid of values more than one, use tanh on the last layer, that actual output will be always at [-1, 1] range.
- Fix vector order. 
- Seeds are flat. Make sure that training data only contain flat systems. Test on only that quite distinguishable. 
- Find a better way to show density of points. Because if point size is big enough, one cannot see difference. 

# Organizational stuff 31.01.2022
- About Informatics course
  - Dokumentation zum promotionsvorhaben, Auflagenzum promotionszulassung
  - Say how much compute time for me was used?
  - Does it include exams? Is there minimum requirement on pass or fail, or just pass better than something
  - Courses are labeld to be kernbereich to Informatik
- Send kindly reminder to Leif, Klin, Möbius, or sekretariat i8, whether I could attend meetings
- Report for JSC:
  - For section 2: 
    - Not list of configuration, high level description, what it is configuration about. 
    - Compute time is less than we applied for, because we have more things to investigate in the future.
    - Data preparation ; we are done with that
  - For section 4 
    - Convolutional nn is low depth, loss function, how to deal latent space.
    - How many run is it, do I need to make a grid search. Before it comes a grid search with early stopping. (or 20)
10 epochs or 100 epochs before real experiment. Typical settings
    - number of cores used: parallelization is not a big deal, I used horovod for parallelization, but typical experiment running on a single node is sufficient.  I should explain, that I did not overly spend computing time, but used it in reasonable manner.
    - For the final run we need more than for testing, because there we will use whole data and more epochs. 
    - Code modification for us will be suitable neural network architecture. But now we know, what works better. 
    - Granted computing time is not fully used, because we didn’t really start with cassava roots, but worked with seeds
    - If needed, jobs are ready to be launched.

#Plan for week from 1.02.2022 till 7.02.2022
- Write report for JSC
- Test validation augmentation on jureca
- Deliver documents to Dekanat 1
  - Ask whether it is enough to send just translation without official letter from notar
- **done** Register for RWTH
- Regress centers of masses
- Modify FC layer size for pose regression
- Write email to Leif's postdocs, that I would like to participate in their seminar as well.

There are different results for minibatches. Some of them have loss around 0.02, and other can be 0.4 - 0.5. And even more, they alternate each other.
![img_22.png](img_22.png)
# Questions to Hanno:
- can I measure accuracy in IoU or Chamfer distance, when performing a regression of point cloud?
- What does it mean? **Due to the implicit nonlinear restrictions enforced by model knowledge in the renderer, we expect slower and less reliable convergence in the training phase.** ![img_23.png](img_23.png)
- What does mean **Investigate suitable handling of 3d information in DNN-based model regression.**? ![img_24.png](img_24.png)
- Plans about 3d root with generalized cylinders. I won’t use an OpenSimRoot because it does not produce comparable photorealistic results. Instead, produce a depthmap in the output of the neural network, and compare it with the ground truth depth map. 
- Will I work on Arabidopsis or just skip this section? roots after seeds?
- Will I work on NeRF?
- Should I repeat experiment with scalability and calculate dataset size and wall clock time on my dataset with 5k seeds?
- Should this proposal be aligned with phd proposal **doktoranden vorschlag**? 
- However, when multiple images need to
be processed in parallel as usual for SfM model-parallel multi-GPU implementations may be needed. ![img_25.png](img_25.png)
- For coordinate-based neural representations we will investigate the regularizing effect of learning initializations together with supplemental supervised outputs, e.g.\ object masks, promoting cleaner surfaces. We expect that this will allow for accurate reconstruction, also in scenes where not all object parts are visible
- Dataloader: all information about one seed in h5 file? or one h5 file for the whole dataset, for example 6k seeds?
- Should I use hyperopt for hyperparameters searching or just grid search for beginning?
- From phenoseeder I have 32k seeds with 36 views and point cloud available, not 10k. 
- Why is one image of a seed is 5 MPix? ROI should be 700*700*1.8 = 0.88 MPix.   
- How to calculate, how much pixels is in point cloud? 
- Why 100 seeds are sufficient? I have overfitting even with 5000 seeds. 

## TODO
- synchronize run of the script with github commit in order to be able to reproduce the same result. Or do it manually after succesfully launched code, with noting experiment number. 
- Print dummy output before first epoch in order to check that output will work as intended
- Use intersection over union or chamfer distance to evaluate 3d reconstruction accuracy. 
- Understand, what does it mean, error in 0.5 for coefficient calculation. 
- There is no information on what is accuracy for regression of spherical harmonics. Should it be measured in terms of accuracy of 3d reconstruction? 

## TODO proposal
- Update preliminary work, include results of report
- Insert in project report about problem that camera center and reconstructed point cloud are not the same for all seeds

Distribution of volumes enclosed by parallelepiped, gained from limits of point clouds. 
![](../notebooks/figs/091.png)
Volumes from 5283 seeds are 522499 plus minus 131024. Approximately it is 523000 plus minus 131000 voxels. 
Approx it is 5e5 plus minus 1e5. 

There are 30699 seeds overall in phenoseeder folder, that contains 36 rotation images. 

## Hanno's tips on 07.02.2022
- Use jureca to run code overnight. 
- If run multiple jobs, it is better to run smaller projects, because I don't need to wait till more nodes will be free
- Use multiple nodes, because after 24 hours it will be stopped

# Period 08.02.2022 to 14.02.2022
- **done** Test validation augmentation on jureca
- Deliver documents to Dekanat 1
  - Ask whether it is enough to send just translation without official letter from notar 
- Regress centers of masses
- Modify FC layer size for pose regression
- Write email to Leif's postdocs, that I would like to participate in their seminar as well.

## TODO 
- **done** there is delay between epochs
- check computational time on jureca, what part is slow
  - check distributed loading with num workers
- gather all results to one place together with configuration file in order to compare them.

## Results
Ablation, if not use all of augmentations, validation is increasing up to 0.64.

Loops for augmenetaion takes 0.3 seconds for every minibatch, consisting of 5 images, 3 view each ![img_30.png](img_30.png)

Huge amount on time spending on dataloading, and it is not synchronized in parallel with training loop:

Dataset 598 consists of 216 Gb, there are 5283*36 images, each with resolution 1000*1800. One image takes approx. 1 Mb. 

Training loop for 3 views, 5200 seeds, 5*3 size of minibatch takes 1380 seconds. Parallel is default torch, machine is workstation. 

## Questions to Hanno
- How technically it is usually creating dataset? Should it be equal to RAM?![img_33.png](img_33.png)
- Does it make sense to test training on small dataset, like 100 or 500 seeds instead of 5300? 

## In Jülich
- Give bike and helmet back
- Take hdd
